AnrizaKuriz.Hangfire.MySqlStorage is forked from [Hangfire.MySqlStorage](https://github.com/arnoldasgudas/Hangfire.MySqlStorage), this package focuses on keeping the dependency stack modern and compatible with current .NET ecosystems.

Changes in this fork:

- Updated `Dapper` to a newer version.
- Updated `Newtonsoft.Json` to a newer version.
- Removed deprecated `System.Data.MySqlClient` dependency (as a consequence of the Dapper update).
